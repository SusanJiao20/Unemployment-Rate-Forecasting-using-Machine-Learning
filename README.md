# Unemployment-Rate-Forecasting-using-Machine-Learning

In this project, my teammates Yuanhang Wang, Yi Xiao, and I forecast unemployment rate using maching learning techiniques such as random forests and neural networks ï¼ˆRNN architecture),
and will use standard time series model (ARIMA) as benchmark models.
