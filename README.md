# Unemployment-Rate-Forecasting-using-Machine-Learning

Building accurate forecasting models for economics indicators is a reserach area that many policy reserachers work on. In this project, my teammates Yuanhang Wang, Yi Xiao, and I exploit machine learning and deep learning techniques to forecast unemployment rate. Using linear regression as a baseline model, we compare results from random forests, XGBoost, and long short-term memory. There are two variants in all models: one uses 11 relevant economic indicators as input features, while anoterh uses unemployment rate as the only feature. We find XGBoost and LSTM to perform the best in the variant that uses all 11 features. Baseline regression model perform the best in the variant the uses only unemployment rate.
